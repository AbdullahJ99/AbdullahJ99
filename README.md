<h2 align="center">Welcome aboard AJ's profile!</h2>
<hr>

I'm AJ, a Front End Developer passionate about making dynamic websites, with a background of complete client satisfaction.

I've always liked creating things, whether it's little drawings, story scripts, or video skits with my little sister. That interest also extended to coding and all the limitless potential it offered. When I'm not working on a coding project, I like expanding upon my list of fictional creative writing and helping my parents with their mediterranean restaurant.
